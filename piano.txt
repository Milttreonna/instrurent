Perfect for beginning students and experienced players alike, the ARIUS / YDP series provides true piano sound and feel. The Graded Hammer keyboard makes it a true joy to play, both in practice and in performance. The 3-level AWM Dynamic Stereo Sampling Voices deliver remarkably authentic sound, and YDP-181 incorporates a USB device port for storing songs recorded on the instrument. Moreover, the damper pedal includes a half-damper effect, giving you nuanced expressive control over the sustained sound. Dual Voice capability lets you play two different instrument sounds at the same time, while a 2-track song recorder allows you to capture your original musical ideas and performances.
